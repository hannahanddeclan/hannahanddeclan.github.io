          In the below sections are some accommodation options we are aware of in the Cockermouth and Keswick area. This definitely isn't an exhaustive list, so there may be better options elsewhere.
          All the travel times are by car using the Google maps travel time estimation.
          The accommodation options in each section are ordered by travel time to the reception venue!

            For the following hotels we have included the link and prices for a double room for one night on Thursday 5th August from their website, but you may be able to find cheaper prices from sites like booking.com.
            There will also be plenty of B&Bs in the area.

              <h1>Armathwaite Hall</h1>
              <p>
                This is the hotel where the reception will take place, so travel after the event will not be needed and the hotel bar remains open for any hotel guests who want to continue after midnight!
                Unfortunately, due to a wedding the day after ours and rooms needed for our immediate wedding party, all the club rooms are booked, so only more expensive rooms are available.

          <div class='accom-details'>
            All of the self-catering options we have found are for week-long stays starting on Friday 30th July or Saturday 31st July. There will be shorter stays available elsewhere, we just haven't researched those.
            Aside from Tallentire Hall, the options are all from the Sally's Cottages company.
            There are multiple other companies doing holiday cottage rental options, including 'Cumbrian', 'Lake Lovers', 'Sykes Cottages' and 'Airbnb'; however, we know Sally's is trustworthy and we're hoping to get a discount on their properties so we've only researched theirs.
            If you want to book any of the self-catering options let us know and we'll ask about a discount for you!

              <h1>Tallentire Hall</h1>
              <p>
                Tallentire Hall is a renovation-in-progress owned by some family friends which currently has two self-catering cottages for holiday rental.
                If both cottages are booked, you'd basically have the place to yourselves, but otherwise may end up sharing the outside space with people booking the second cottage.

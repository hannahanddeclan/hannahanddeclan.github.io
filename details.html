        <h1>What is this website?</h1>
        <p>Since we're both developers, I (Hannah) thought we should definitely have a wedding website; <strong>however</strong>, I haven't had as much time to devote to it as I'd hoped!</p>
        <p>Please excuse the lack of mobile compatibility and keep an eye for updates on information (a lot of details are still TBC!)</p>
        <h1>Covid-19</h1>
        <p>We are hoping that next year restrictions due to covid precautions are reduced and so we have invited everyone we would like to attend, but please be aware we may need to revise the guest list if restrictions are still in place.</p>
        <h1>Information for those travelling on the day</h1>
        <p>The church has bathrooms and a private room for those who are travelling on the day and need to freshen up</p>
        <h1>Parking</h1>
        <p>We will update with more information on church parking when we know more!</p>
        <p>The hotel is 20 minutes drive from the church and there is plenty of space for cars</p>
        <h1>Is the wedding outside?</h1>
        <p>Weather permitting, we will be having reception drinks outside on the lawns of the hotel, so please bear this in mind when chosing your shoes!</p>
        <h1>Day timings</h1>
        <p>
          This is still to be decided, but current suggested timings are:
          <ul>
            <li>11:30 ceremony</li>
            <li>13:30 reception drinks</li>
            <li>15:00 wedding breakfast</li>
            <li>19:00 evening reception begins</li>
            <li>23:45 last song and taxis</li>
            <li>00:00 all non-hotel guests must have left, and hotel guests are free to move to the cocktail bar if they plan to carry on!</li>
          </ul>
